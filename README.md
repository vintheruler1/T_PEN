# T_PEN - DIY TMJ Therapeutic Pen

## What is a TMJ Pen?

A TMJ pen is a therapeutic device that uses vibration to help relieve temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain and tension. It's designed to be applied to the jaw muscles to help reduce locking, stiffness, and discomfort.

## Why I Made This

I have severe jaw issues where my TMJ locks up, but I cannot afford to spend $250 on a commercial TMJ pen. So I decided to make my own!
